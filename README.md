# Automated Email OTP Service with Python

## Overview

This project is a Python-based automated One-Time Password (OTP) service that generates a secure six-digit OTP and sends it to a user's email address for verification purposes. It uses Python's `random` module for OTP generation and `smtplib` for sending the OTP via email. The system then prompts the user to input the received OTP and verifies its correctness.

## Features

- **OTP Generation:** A six-digit OTP is generated using Python's `random` module.
- **Email Automation:** The OTP is sent to the user's email address using Python's `smtplib` and the Gmail SMTP server.
- **User Verification:** The user is prompted to enter the received OTP, which is then validated against the generated OTP.
- **Secure Authentication:** Ensures that only users with access to the specified email address can complete the verification process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A Gmail account with "App Password" enabled
- Basic knowledge of Python and email protocols

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-email-otp-service.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd automated-email-otp-service
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries:**
   The necessary libraries are part of Python's standard library, so no external installations are required.

## Usage

1. **Set Up Your Gmail Account:**
   - Enable "Less secure app access" or generate an "App Password" in your Gmail account settings.

2. **Update the Code with Your Gmail Credentials:**
   - Replace the `from_mail` variable in the code with your Gmail address.
   - Replace the `server.login()` method's password argument with your "App Password."

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python otp_service.py
   ```

4. **Enter the Recipient's Email:**
   - When prompted, enter the email address where the OTP should be sent.

5. **Verify the OTP:**
   - Check the recipient's email for the OTP.
   - Enter the received OTP when prompted in the terminal.

6. **Result:**
   - If the OTP is correct, the terminal will display "OTP Verified."
   - If the OTP is incorrect, the terminal will display "OTP Invalid."

## Code Explanation

- **OTP Generation:** The code generates a six-digit OTP using a `for` loop and `random.randint(0, 9)` to ensure randomness.
- **Email Setup:** The script connects to the Gmail SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com`) using `smtplib.SMTP`, starts TLS encryption, and logs in using the provided Gmail credentials.
- **Email Sending:** The OTP is embedded in the email content and sent to the recipient using `server.send_message(msg)`.
- **User Input:** The script prompts the user to input the received OTP and compares it with the generated OTP to verify the user's identity.

## Example

```
Enter Your Email: user@example.com
Email Sended
Enter the OTP: 123456
OTP Verified
```
